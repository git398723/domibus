        <para>Domibus provides a plugin for the Eclipse IDE which can be used to
            genetate configuration XML files. Eclipse can be obtained for free
            <link xl:href="http://www.eclipse.org/">here</link>. The plugin has been tested with
            Eclipse 4.4, but should work for all recent versions.

            To install the plugin use
            <uri>https://secure.e-codex.eu/updates</uri>
            as updatesite.

            This plugin requires the Xtext SDK as dependency. It should be
            installed automatically. If that is not the case you can install it
            manually from the default Eclipse update sites.
        </para>
        <para>
            To start writing the configuration create a new Eclipse general
            project. Create a file with a
            <computeroutput>.pconf</computeroutput>
            extension. The plugin adds the required project configuration
            automatically. Syntax highlighting and code completion are
            supported.
        </para>

            <para>The
                <computeroutput>.pconf</computeroutput>
                file is used to generate the concrete Domibus PMode XML
                configuration files. It is not understood directly by Domibus.

        <title>Writing the configuration</title>
        <para>
            The configutration is written in a domain specific language which is
            then transformed to XML. An example file looks like this:
            <programlisting language="domibus-conf">
                <xi:include href="graphics/example.pconf" parse="text"/>
            </programlisting>
            <note>
                <para>If the file is valid the plugin generates one xml file per
                    <computeroutput>Party</computeroutput>
                    on the fly.
                    Those can be found in the
                    <computeroutput>src-gen</computeroutput>
                    folder of the project.
                </para>
