/**
 * This transport-channel-bound MEP involves the transfer of a single ebMS User Message unit (label:
 * "oneway"). This MEP is initiated by the Receiving MSH, over a two-way underlying transport protocol. The
 * first leg of the protocol exchange carries a Pull Signal message. The second leg returns the pulled User
 * Message unit. To conform to this MEP the pulled User Message unit MUST NOT include an
 * eb:RefToMessageId element. In case no message is available for pulling, an ebMS error signal of severity
 * level "warning" and short description of "EmptyMessagePartitionChannel", as listed in Section 6.7.1,
 * MUST be returned over the response leg.
