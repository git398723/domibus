/**
 * This element has the following attributes:
 * • eb:Messaging/eb:UserMessage/@mpc: This OPTIONAL attribute contains a URI that
 * identifies the Message Partition Channel to which the message is assigned. The absence of this
 * element indicates the use of the default MPC. When the message is pulled, the value of this
 * attribute MUST indicate the MPC requested in the PullRequest message.
 * This element has the following children elements:
 * • eb:Messaging/eb:UserMessage/eb:MessageInfo: This REQUIRED element occurs once,
 * and contains data that identifies the message, and relates to other messages' identifiers.
 * • eb:Messaging/eb:UserMessage/eb:PartyInfo: This REQUIRED element occurs once,
 * and contains data about originating party and destination party.
 * • eb:Messaging/eb:UserMessage/eb:CollaborationInfo: This REQUIRED element
 * occurs once, and contains elements that facilitate collaboration between parties.
 * • eb:Messaging/eb:UserMessage/eb:MessageProperties: This OPTIONAL element
 * occurs at most once, and contains message properties that are user-specific. As parts of the
 * header such properties allow for more efficient monitoring, correlating, dispatching and validating
 * functions (even if these are out of scope of ebMS specification) which would otherwise require
 * payload access.
 * • eb:Messaging/eb:UserMessage/eb:PayloadInfo: This OPTIONAL element occurs at
 * most once, and identifies payload data associated with the message, whether included as part of
 * the message as payload document(s) contained in a Payload Container, or remote resources
 * accessible via a URL. The purpose of the PayloadInfo is (a) to make it easier to directly extract a
 * particular payload associated with this User message, (b) to allow an application to determine
 * whether it can process the payload without having to parse it.
